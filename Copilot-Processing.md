## Current Phase: Lint Cleanup Priority

### Summary

The immediate focus is on resolving 13 critical lint errors (regex escapes, React hooks, import extensions) that block further progress. Over 5000 lint warnings exist but are non-blocking for now.

### Key Actions

1. Fix 13 critical lint errors (see validation-output.txt for details)
2. Run `pnpm run lint:fix` to address as many warnings as possible
3. Validate `.env` and config files against schema
4. Validate seed system with dry run
5. Update Memory Bank and task index
6. Break down and phase the 37-task plan

### Next Steps

- Complete lint cleanup (critical errors first)
- Validate environment and seed system
- Document progress and update tasks
- Begin phased implementation of remaining tasks
