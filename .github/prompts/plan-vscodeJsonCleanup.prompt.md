read and analyze all .vscode/_.json files in the project
summarize their current settings and identify issues or redundancies
back up each file (e.g., copy to .vscode/backup/ or rename with .bak)
delete the original .vscode/_.json files
create new, clean .vscode/\*.json files with:

- consistent formatting and indentation
- recommended extensions for Node.js, React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind
- optimized settings for linting, formatting, TypeScript, and testing
- tasks and launch configs for common workflows
- comments (where supported) for clarity
  ensure each file (settings.json, extensions.json, tasks.json, launch.json) is recreated with best practices for the stack
